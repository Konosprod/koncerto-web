# Koncerto Website

A website for creating blind test, based on youtube urls for a discord bot named Koncerto.

## Installation

You can install it by downloading the sources here : [last release](https://github.com/Konosprod/koncerto-web/releases/latest).

You can also clone the repository :
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Konosprod/koncerto-web.git
$ cd koncerto-web/
```

When the source code is obtained, you have to setup a new user for your mysql, or use an existing one. Once it's done, you have to use the file in `sql/koncerto.sql` to setup the database.

Once it's done, you have to edit `config.php`and put your config. Now, everything should be ok.
